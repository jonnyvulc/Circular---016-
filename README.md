BACKGROUND
  
1. What is the purpose of this Circular?
This revised Circular provides for improvements in coordination and use of spatial data. Spatial data refers to information about places or geography, and has traditionally been shown on maps. This Circular describes the effective and economical use and management of spatial data assets in the digital environment for the benefit of the government and the nation. The Circular affirms and describes the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) as the technology, policies, standards, human resources, and related activities necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve spatial data. The Circular describes the management and reporting requirements of Federal agencies in the acquisition, maintenance, distribution, use, and preservation of spatial data by the Federal Government. The Circular establishes the FGDC as the interagency coordinating body for NSDI-related activities, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior with the Deputy Director for Management, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as Vice-Chair.
This revised Circular supersedes Circular No. A-l6 dated October 19, 1990, and incorporates Executive Order 12906. It will remain in effect until replaced pursuant to section 8.e.(j) of this Circular. A basic list of authorities is included in Appendix A.
2. What is the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)?
a. What is the vision for the NSDI?
The NSDI assures that spatial data from multiple sources (federal, state, local, and tribal governments, academia, and the private sector) are available and easily integrated to enhance the understanding of our physical and cultural world. The NSDI honors several key public values:
 Privacy and security of citizens' personal data and accuracy of statistical information on people, both in raw form and in derived information products.
 Access for all citizens to spatial data, information, and interpretive products, in accordance with OMB Circular A-130.
 Protection of proprietary interests related to licensed information and data.
 Interoperability of federal information systems to enable the drawing of resources from multiple federal
agencies and their partners.
The NSDI supports and advances the building of a Global Spatial Data Infrastructure, consistent with national security, national defense, national intelligence, and international trade requirements. International compatibility is an important aspect of the NSDI. Federal agencies

will develop their international spatial data in compliance with international voluntary consensus standards, as defined by Circular A-119.
b. What are the components of the NSDI?
The components of the NSDI are data themes, metadata, the National Spatial Data Clearinghouse, standards, and partnerships.
(1) What are data themes?
Data themes are electronic records and coordinates for a topic or subject, such as elevation or vegetation. This Circular requires the development, maintenance, and dissemination of a standard core set of digital spatial information for the Nation that will serve as a foundation for users of geographic information. This set of data consists of themes of national significance (see Appendix E). Themes providing the core, most commonly used set of base data are known as framework data, specifically geodetic control, orthoimagery, elevation and bathymetry, transportation, hydrography, cadastral, and governmental units. Other themes of national significance are also an important part of the NSDI, and must be available to share with others. Additional data themes may be added with the approval of the FGDC.
NSDI data themes developed with appropriate metadata, using FGDC standards and served through the Clearinghouse, facilitate interoperability and information exchange across administrative boundaries.
(2) What are metadata?
Metadata are information about data and/or geospatial services, such as content, source, vintage, spatial scale, accuracy, projection, responsible party, contact phone number, method of collection, and other descriptions. Metadata are critical to document, preserve and protect agencies' spatial data assets. Reliable metadata, structured in a standardized manner, are essential to ensuring that geospatial data are used appropriately, and that any resulting analysis is credible. Metadata also can be used to facilitate the search and access of data sets or geospatial services within a Clearinghouse or data library. All spatial data collected or derived directly or indirectly using federal funds will have FGDC metadata.
(3) What is the National Spatial Data Clearinghouse?
The National Spatial Data Clearinghouse is an electronic service providing access to documented spatial data and metadata from distributed data sources. These sources include a network of data producers, managers, and users, linked through the Internet and other communications means, and accessible through a common interface. All spatial data collected by federal agencies or their agents,

as described in section 5, will be made available through the Clearinghouse. Spatial data users will have access to the NSDI through the National Spatial Data Clearinghouse.
(4) What are standards?
Standards are common and repeated rules, conditions, guidelines or characteristics for data, and related processes, technology and organization. To broaden the global use of federal data and services, international standards and protocols must be used. NSDI is made possible by the universal use of standards and protocols for data development, documentation, exchange, and geospatial services.
(5) How are NSDI standards developed?
NSDI standards are developed and promulgated by the FGDC in accordance with OMB Circular A-119 using an established process determined by the FGDC with input from a broad range of data users and providers. Specifically, the FGDC adopts national and international standards in lieu of federal standards whenever possible and will restrict its standards development activities to areas of spatial data standardization not covered by other voluntary standards consensus bodies, as defined by OMB Circular A-119. Through active participation in voluntary consensus standards bodies, the FGDC works to link its standardization activities to the work of those standards bodies and thereby create an integrated suite of standards for the NSDI. No federal funds will be used directly or indirectly for the development of spatial data not complying with NSDI standards, as specified by FGDC.
(6) What is the importance of collaborative partnerships?
Building an effective NSDI will require a well-coordinated effort among federal, tribal, state, local government, and academic institutions, as well as a broad array of private sector geographic, statistical, demographic, and other business information providers and users. Involving these stakeholders in the development of the NSDI will aid in meeting the needs of end-users.
Federal agencies will promote and fully utilize partnerships that promote cost-effective data collection, documentation, maintenance, distribution, and preservation strategies, and that leverage federal and other resources. New collaborative efforts and partnerships are encouraged.
(7) What are the federal activities and technology that support the NSDI?
Federal agencies and the FGDC carry out the activities required to implement their responsibilities as described in section 8 of this Circular. Agencies will provide or develop the required technology and services required to enable and provide access to NSDI data and information. The OMB will work with affected budget offices to provide appropriate resources in support of these activities.

3. What are the benefits of the NSDI?
Spatial data is a national capital asset. The NSDI facilitates efficient collection, sharing, and dissemination of spatial data among all levels of government institutions, as well as the public and private sectors, to address issues affecting the Nation's physical, economic, and social well-being. A coordinated approach for developing spatial data standards that apply to collecting, maintaining, distributing, using, and preservation of data will improve the quality of federal spatial data and reduce the cost of derivative products created by federal and non-federal users. Applications using spatial data that adhere to FGDC standards enable cost effective public and private policy development, management, and operations.
Implementation of this Circular is essential to help federal agencies eliminate duplication, avoid redundant expenditures, reduce resources spent on unfunded mandates, accelerate the development of electronic government to meet the needs and expectations of citizens and agency programmatic mandates, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public management.
Many applications are dependent upon accurate spatial data. The benefits of the NSDI for these applications include creating a more secure Nation. Some examples include the analysis and management of utility infrastructures, transportation, energy, emergency management and response, natural resource management, weather and climate analysis, disaster recovery, homeland defense, law enforcement, protection planning, public health and other civilian or military strategic issues. The seamless spatial information needed for these applications can range from highly detailed local data, such as the nature of specific hazardous material stored in a particular room of a single building, to the various data needed for real-time projection of the probable effects of natural disasters.
4. What is the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)?
The FGDC is an interagency committee responsible for facilitating Circular A-l6 related activities and
implementation of the NSDI.
a. What is the FGDC structure and membership?
The FGDC is chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, with the Deputy Director for Management, OMB, serving as Vice-Chair. Chair and Vice-Chair may designate an individual to act in their stead. All agencies responsible for spatial data themes are required to be members of the FGDC. Departments or agencies that are members of the FGDC as of the date of this revision will continue as members and are listed in Appendix B. Departments or agencies that are not members of the FGDC and that have activities in geographic information or spatial data collection or use will become members by requesting membership in writing to the Chair of the FGDC.
b. What are the FGDC procedures?

The FGDC will establish procedures and committee structures as are necessary and sufficient to carry out interagency coordination and the implementation of the NSDI, in accordance with existing law, statute, and policy. Departments may elect or be assigned the lead responsibility for certain subcommittees, working groups or other committees, consistent with each Department's or agency's existing authority as described in its mission (e.g., statutory authority or Public Law), or implied as part of its program responsibilities. The current FGDC governing structure and bylaws are carried forward and remain in force under this Circular, and may be modified according to existing procedures. The Department of the Interior will provide administrative support to the FGDC.

Appendix C: History and Background of Circular A-16
This Circular was originally issued in 1953, revised in 1967, and revised again in 1990. The Bureau of the Budget (now the OMB) issued Circular No. A-16 on January 16, 1953. Appended to this Circular
    
were Exhibits, occasionally revised, that dealt with procedures for programming and coordinating of federal Topographic Mapping Activities, National Atlas, Geodetic Control Surveys and International Boundaries.
The purpose of the 1953 Circular was "to insure (sic) that surveying and mapping activities may be directed toward meeting the needs of federal and state agencies and the general public, and will be performed expeditiously, without duplication of effort." The original Circular references Executive Order No. 9094, dated March 10, 1942. This Executive Order directs the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to coordinate and promote the improvement of surveying and mapping activities of the Government. Furthermore, it passes on functions carried out by the Federal Board of Surveys and Maps, established by Executive Order No. 3206, dated December 30, 1919. Thus, the OMB is directed to make recommendations to agencies and to the President regarding the coordination of all governmental map making and surveying. Executive Order No. 3206 superseded an Executive Order, dated August 10, 1906, that granted advisory power to the United States Geographic Board to review mapping projects to avoid duplication and to facilitate standardized mapping.
A revised Circular A-16 was issued on May 6, 1967. The most significant change in this revision is the addition of a new section on Responsibility for Coordination. This section outlines the responsibilities of three federal departments (Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Commerce (DOC) and Department of State (DOS)). Both the original and the 1967 revision of the Circular focus on providing a guide for the development of annual programs of the individual agencies and, through the Exhibits, established extensive reporting requirements.
A second revised Circular A-16 was issued on October 19, 1990. This revision expanded the Circular to include not only surveying and mapping, but also the related spatial data activities. Specifically, it included geographically referenced computer-readable (digital) data. In addition, the Exhibits are no longer referenced and a short reporting requirements section is added.
The 2002 updated Circular calls for continued improvements in spatial data coordination and the use of geographical data. Objectives for this revision are to reflect the changes that have taken place in geographic information management and technology, and to clearly define agency and FGDC responsibilities. The proposed revision displays an integrated infrastructure system approach to support multiple government services and electronic government.
Appendix D: Informative Definitions
  
Analog: Of, relating to, or being a device in which data are represented by variable measurable physical quantities. In this Circular, refers to "paper" maps.
Preserve: The process of saving and storing data or records. May also refer to the place where data or information is kept.
Clearinghouse: A distributed network of data producers, managers, and users linked electronically, such as over the Internet. Through the Clearinghouse, users can use a single interface to search and access metadata and/or data for the themes they seek. The Clearinghouse includes the sites across the country where the metadata and data are stored, usually at the site of the producer or intermediary.
Data: Factual information, especially information organized for analysis or used to reason or make decisions. In Computer Science, numerical or other information represented in a form suitable for processing by computer.
Data Theme: Electronic records and coordinates for a topic or subject, such as elevation, vegetation, or hydrography. In this Circular, data theme refers to a Geographic Information System (GIS), or location-based data theme.
Framework Data: Seven themes of geospatial data that are used by most GIS applications (geodetic control, orthoimagery, elevation and bathymetry, transportation, hydrography, cadastral and governmental units). These data include an encoding of the geographic extent of the features and a minimal number of attributes needed to identify and describe the features.
Framework: The NSDI framework is an initiative to develop a readily available set of basic geographic data. It includes the information, operational environment, and technology to provide access to these data, and the institutional setting to sustain its development.
Geographic Information: Coordinate and attribute data for location-based features, usually in the categories of point (e.g., a well), line (e.g., a road), polygon (e.g., a forest), cell (e.g., a raster-based "rectangle"), or coordinates (e.g., the latitude-longitude of a point on the ground).
Geographic Information System: A computer system for the input, editing, storage, retrieval, analysis, synthesis, and output of location-based information. GIS may refer to hardware and software, or include data.
Georeference: A set of datums by which the location of each point can be uniquely identified.
Geospatial Data: Information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the Earth. This information may be derived from, among other

things, remote sensing, mapping, and surveying technologies. Statistical data may be included in this definition at the discretion of the collecting agency.
Geospatial Services: A collection of operations, accessible through an interface that allows a user to evoke a behavior of value to the user.
Global Positioning System: A satellite-based system deployed to determine locations on the Earth's surface. It is commonly used for surveying, mapping, and navigation on land and water.
Metadata: Information about data, such as content, source, vintage, accuracy, condition, projection, responsible party, contact phone number, method of collection, and other characteristics or descriptions.
National Spatial Data Infrastructure: The technology, policies, standards, human resources, and related activities necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve spatial data (e.g., information and process discovery, publishing data, publishing symbol libraries, query filtering, data fusing, Earth imaging, photogrammetry, location processing, and spatial analysis).
Proven Practices: Methods and activities that are "tried and true" including, but not limited to "best practice."
Spatial Data: Information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the Earth. This information may be derived from remote sensing, mapping, charting, surveying technologies, GPS, or statistical data, among other sources.
Spatial Data Standards: Descriptions of objects, features, or other geographically located items that are collected, automated, or affected by activities or functions of agencies, and may be structured in a model.
Standards: Documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes, or services are fit for their purposes.
Technology: The scientific method and material used to achieve a commercial or industrial objective. Jargon for "software," "hardware," "protocol," or something technical in nature.
Appendix E: NSDI Data Themes, Definitions, and Lead Agencies
The lead federal agencies with responsibilities for NSDI spatial data themes are as follows:
  
Baseline (Maritime): Co-leaders: DOC, NOAA and DOI, Minerals Management Service (MMS)
Baseline represents the line from which maritime zones and limits are measured. Examples of these limits include the territorial sea, contiguous zone, and exclusive economic zone. The spatial extent of the baseline is defined as "ordinary low water," interpreted as mean lower low water, as depicted on National Ocean Service nautical charts and/or appropriate supplemental information.
Biological Resources: DOI, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
This dataset includes data pertaining to or descriptive of (nonhuman) biological resources and their distributions and habitats, including data at the suborganismal (genetics, physiology, anatomy, etc.), organismal (subspecies, species, systematics), and ecological (populations, communities, ecosystems, biomes, etc.) levels.
*Cadastral: DOI, Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
Cadastral data describe the geographic extent of past, current, and future right, title, and interest in real property, and the framework to support the description of that geographic extent. The geographic extent includes survey and description frameworks such as the Public Land Survey System, as well as parcel-by-parcel surveys and descriptions.
*Cadastral (Offshore): DOI, MMS
Offshore Cadastre is the land management system used on the Outer Continental Shelf. It extends from the baseline to the extent of United States jurisdiction. Existing coverage is currently limited to the conterminous United States and portions of Alaska. Maximum extent of United States jurisdiction is not yet mathematically calculated.
Climate: Co-leaders, Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and DOC, NOAA
Climate data describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Earth's atmosphere/hydrosphere/land surface system. These data represent both model-generated and observed (either in situ or remotely sensed) environmental information, which can be summarized to describe surface, near surface and atmospheric conditions over a range of scales.
Cultural and Demographic Statistics: DOC, U.S. Census Bureau (USCB)
These geospatially referenced data describe the characteristics of people, the nature of the structures in which they live and work, the economic and other activities they pursue, the facilities they use to support their health, recreational and other needs, the environmental consequences of their presence,

and the boundaries, names and numeric codes of geographic entities used to report the information collected.
Cultural Resources: DOI, National Park Service
The cultural resources theme includes historic places such as districts, sites, buildings, and structures of significance in history, architecture, engineering, or culture. Cultural resources also encompass prehistoric features as well as historic landscapes.
*Digital Ortho Imagery: DOI, USGS
This dataset contains georeferenced images of the Earth's surface, collected by a sensor in which image object displacement has been removed for sensor distortions and orientation, and terrain relief. For very large surface areas, an Earth curvature correction may be applied. Digital orthoimages encode the optical electromagnetic spectrum as discrete values modeled in an array of georeferenced pixels. Digital orthoimages have the geometric characteristics of a map, and image qualities of a photograph.
Earth Cover: DOI, USGS
The Earth Cover theme uses a hierarchical classification system based on observable form and structure, as opposed to function or use. This system transitions from generalized to more specific and detailed class divisions, and provides a framework within which multiple land cover and land use classification systems can be cross-referenced. This system is applicable everywhere on the surface of the Earth. This theme differs from the Vegetation and Wetlands themes, which provide additional detail.
*Elevation Bathymetric: Co-leaders: DOC, NOAA (U.S. waters outside channels) and US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (inland waterways)
The bathymetric data for Inland and Intercoastal waterways is highly accurate bathymetric sounding information collected to ensure that federal navigation channels are maintained to their authorized depths. Bathymetric survey activities support the Nation's critical nautical charting program. This data is also used to create Electronic Navigational Charts. The bathymetric sounding data supports the elevation layer of the geospatial data framework.
*Elevation Terrestrial: DOI, USGS
This data contains georeferenced digital representations of terrestrial surfaces, natural or manmade, which describe vertical position above or below a datum surface. Data may be encapsulated in an evenly spaced grid (raster form) or randomly spaced (triangular irregular network, hypsography, single points). The elevation points can have varying horizontal and vertical resolution and accuracy.
Buildings and Facilities: General Services Administration

The facility theme includes federal sites or entities with a geospatial location deliberately establish ed for designated activities; a facility database might describe a factory, military base, college, hospital, power plant, fishery, national park, office building, space command center, or prison. Facility data is submitted from several agencies, since there is no one party responsible for all the facilities in the Nation, and facilities encompass a broad spectrum of activities. The FGDC promotes standardizing on database structures and schemas to the extent practical.
Federal Land Ownership Status: DOI, BLM
Federal land ownership status includes the establishment and maintenance of a system for the storage and dissemination of information describing all title, estate or interest of the federal government in a parcel of real and mineral property. The ownership status system is the portrayal of title for all such federal estates or interests in land.
Flood Hazards: Federal Emergency Management Agency
National Flood Insurance Program has prepared flood hazard data for approximately 18,000 communities. The primary information prepared for these communities is for the 1 percent annual chance (100-year) flood, and includes documentation of the boundaries and elevations of that flood.
*Geodetic Control: DOC, NOAA
Geodetic control provides a common reference system for establishing coordinates for all geographic data. All NSDI framework data and users' applications data require geodetic control to accurately register spatial data. The National Spatial Reference System is the fundamental geodetic control for the United States.
Geographic Names: DOI, USGS
This dataset contains data or information on geographic place names deemed official for federal use by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names as pursuant to Public Law 80-242. Geographic Names information includes both the official place name (current, historical, and aliases) and locative direct (i.e., geographic coordinates) and indirect (i.e., State and County where place is located) geospatial identifiers and categorized as populated places, schools, reservoirs, parks, streams, valleys, and ridges.
Geologic: DOI, USGS
The geologic spatial data theme includes all geologic mapping information and related geoscience spatial data (including associated geophysical, geochemical, geochronologic, and paleontologic data) that can contribute to the National Geologic Map Database as pursuant to Public Law 106-148.

*Governmental Units: DOC, USCB
These data describe, by a consistent set of rules and semantic definitions, the official boundary of federal, state, local, and tribal governments as reported/certified to the U.S. Census Bureau by responsible officials of each government for purposes of reporting the Nation's official statistics.
Housing: Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
HUD's database maintains geographic data on homeownership rates, including many attributes such as HUD revitalization zones, location of various forms of housing assistance, first-time homebuyers, underserved areas, and race. Data standards have not yet been formalized.
*Hydrography: DOI, USGS
This data theme includes surface water features such as lakes, ponds, streams and rivers, canals, oceans, and coastlines. Each hydrography feature is assigned a permanent feature identification code (Environmental Protection Agency Reach Code) and may also be identified by a feature name. Spatial positions of features are encoded as centerlines and polygons. Also encoded is network connectivity and direction of flow.
International Boundaries: Department of State
International boundary data include both textual information to describe, and GIS digital cartographic data to depict, both land and maritime international boundaries, other lines of separation, limits, zones, enclaves/exclaves and special areas between States and dependencies.
Law Enforcement Statistics: Department of Justice
Law enforcement statistics describe the occurrence of events (including incidences, offenses and arrests) geospatially located, related to ordinance and statutory violations and the individuals involved in those occurrences. Also included are data related to deployment of law enforcement resources and performance measures.
Marine Boundaries: Co-leaders: DOC, NOAA and DOI, MMS
Marine boundaries depict offshore waters and seabeds over which the United States has sovereignty
and jurisdiction.
Offshore Minerals: DOI, MMS
Offshore minerals include minerals occurring in submerged lands. Examples of marine minerals include oil, gas, sulfur, gold, sand and gravel, and manganese.

Outer Continental Shelf Submerged Lands: DOI, MMS
This data includes lands covered by water at any stage of the tide, as distinguished from tidelands, which are attached to the mainland or an island and cover and uncover with the tide. Tidelands presuppose a high-water line as the upper boundary; whereas submerged lands do not.
Public Health: Department of Health and Human Services
Public health themes relate to the protection, improvement and promotion of the health and safety of all people. For example, public health databases include spatial data on mortality and natality events, infectious and notifiable diseases, incident cancer cases, behavioral risk factor and tuberculosis surveillance, hazardous substance releases and health effects, hospital statistics and other similar data.
Public Land Conveyance (patent) Records: DOI, BLM
Public land conveyance data are the records that describe all past, current, and future, right, title, and interest in real property. This is a system of storage, retrieval and dissemination of documents describing the right, title, and interest of a parcel.
Shoreline: DOC, NOAA
Shorelines represent the intersection of the land with the water surface. The shoreline shown on NOAA Charts represents the line of contact between the land and a selected water elevation. In areas affected by tidal fluctuations, this line of contact is the mean high water line.
Soils: USDA, NRCS
Soil data consist of georeferenced digital map data and associated tabular attribute data. The map data describe the spatial distribution of the various soils that cover the Earth's surface. The attribute data describe the proportionate extent of the various soils as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of those soils. The physical and chemical properties are based on observed and measured values, as well as model-generated values. Also included are model-generated assessments of the suitability or limitations of the soils to various land uses.
*Transportation: Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics
Transportation data are used to model the geographic locations, interconnectedness, and characteristics of the transportation system within the United States. The transportation system includes both physical and non-physical components representing all modes of travel that allow the movement of goods and people between locations.

Transportation (Marine): USACE
The Navigation Channel Framework consists of highly accurate dimensions (geographic coordinates for channel sides, centerlines, wideners, turning basins, and River Mile Markers) for every federal navigation channel maintained by USACE. The Navigation Framework will provide the basis for the marine transportation theme of the geospatial data framework.
Vegetation: USDA, U.S. Forest Service
Vegetation data describe a collection of plants or plant communities with distinguishable characteristics that occupy an area of interest. Existing vegetation covers or is visible at or above the land or water surface and does not include abiotic factors that tend to describe potential vegetation.
Watershed Boundaries: Co-leaders: DOI, USGS and USDA, NRCS
This data theme encodes hydrologic, watershed boundaries into topographically defined sets of drainage areas, organized in a nested hierarchy by size, and based on a standard hydrologic unit coding system.
Wetlands: DOI, Fish and Wildlife Service
The wetlands data layer provides the classification, location, and extent of wetlands and deepwater habitats. There is no attempt to define the proprietary limits or jurisdictional wetland boundaries of any federal, state, or local agencies.
Lead Agency responsibilities and new data themes may be added or altered by recommendation of the FGDC and concurrence by the OMB.
